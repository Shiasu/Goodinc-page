They comprise the extant families Odobenidae (whose only living member is the walrus), Otariidae (the eared seals: sea lions and fur seals), and Phocidae (the earless seals, or true seals). There are 33 extant species of pinnipeds, and more than 50 extinct species have been described from fossils. While seals were historically thought to have descended from two ancestral lines, molecular evidence supports them as a monophyletic lineage (descended from one ancestral line). Pinnipeds belong to the order Carnivora and their closest living relatives are bears and musteloids (weasels, raccoons, skunks, and red pandas), having diverged about 50 million years ago.</p></div><span class="show-comments-button">Show comments</span><span class="add-comment-button">Add comment</span></div><!-- Comment showing imitation on JS --><div class="story-comments"><div class="comment"><h3 class="commentator">Comment by <span class="commentator-name"></span></h3><p class="comment-date"></p><p class="comment-text"></p></div></div><div class="story"><h2>What do you know about Mars? I can tell you something...</h2><p class="story-info-string">11.11.2019 <span>|</span> 1 comments</p><p>Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System after Mercury. In English, Mars carries a name of the Roman god of war and is often referred to as the 'Red Planet'.</p><div class="full-story"><p>The latter refers to the effect of the iron oxide prevalent on Mars' surface, which gives it a reddish appearance distinctive among the astronomical bodies visible to the naked eye. Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere, having surface features reminiscent both of the impact craters of the Moon and the valleys, deserts, and polar ice caps of Earth.</p><p>The days and seasons are likewise comparable to those of Earth, because the rotational period as well as the tilt of the rotational axis relative to the ecliptic plane are very similar. Mars is the site of Olympus Mons, the largest volcano and highest known mountain on any planet in the Solar System, and of Valles Marineris, one of the largest canyons in the Solar System. The smooth Borealis basin in the northern hemisphere covers 40% of the planet and may be a giant impact feature. Mars has two moons, Phobos and Deimos, which are small and irregularly shaped. These may be captured asteroids, similar to 5261 Eureka, a Mars trojan.</p><p>Mars has been explored by numerous unmanned spacecraft. Mariner 4, launched by NASA on November 28, 1964, was the first spacecraft to visit Mars, making its closest approach to the planet on July 15, 1965. Mariner 4 detected the weak Martian radiation belt, measured at about 0.1% that of Earthâ€™s, and captured the first images of another planet from deep space. On July 20, 1976, Viking 1 performed the first successful landing on the Martian surface. Although the Soviet Mars 3 spacecraft achieved a soft landing in December 1971, contact was lost with its lander seconds after touchdown. On July 4, 1997, the Mars Pathfinder spacecraft landed on Mars, and on July 5 released its rover, Sojourner, the first robotic rover to operate on Mars. Pathfinder was followed by the Mars Exploration Rovers, Spirit and Opportunity, which landed on Mars in January 2004 and operated until March 22, 2010 and June 10, 2018, respectively. The Mars Express orbiter, the first European Space Agency spacecraft to visit Mars, arrived in orbit on December 25, 2003. On September 24, 2014, the Indian Space Research Organization became the fourth space agency to visit Mars, when its maiden interplanetary mission, the Mars Orbiter Mission spacecraft, successfully arrived in orbit.</p></div><span class="show-comments-button">Show comments</span><span class="add-comment-button">Add comment</span></div><!-- Comment showing imitation on JS --><div class="story-comments"><div class="comment"><h3 class="commentator">Comment by <span class="commentator-name"></span></h3><p class="comment-date"></p><p class="comment-text"></p></div></div><div class="story"><h2>I love mountains!</h2><p class="story-info-string">10.11.2019 <span>|</span> 1 comments</p><p>A mountain is a large landform that rises above the surrounding land in a limited area, usually in the form of a peak. A mountain is generally steeper than a hill. Mountains are formed through tectonic forces or volcanism.</p><div class="full-story"><p>These forces can locally raise the surface of the earth. Mountains erode slowly through the action of rivers, weather conditions, and glaciers. A few mountains are isolated summits, but most occur in huge mountain ranges. High elevations on mountains produce colder climates than at sea level. These colder climates strongly affect the ecosystems of mountains: different elevations have different plants and animals. Because of the less hospitable terrain and climate, mountains tend to be used less for agriculture and more for resource extraction and recreation, such as mountain climbing and skiing. The highest mountain on Earth is Mount Everest in the Himalayas of Asia, whose summit is 8,850 m (29,035 ft) above mean sea level. The highest known mountain on any planet in the Solar System is Olympus Mons on Mars at 21,171 m (69,459 ft).</p></div><span class="show-comments-button">Show comments</span><span class="add-comment-button">Add comment</span></div><!-- Comment showing imitation on JS --><div class="story-comments"><div class="comment"><h3 class="commentator">Comment by <span class="commentator-name"></span></h3><p class="comment-date"></p><p class="comment-text"></p></div></div><div class="toggle-stories"><p class="toggle-stories-text">Read more</p><i class="fa fa-plus-circle fa-3x" aria-hidden="true"></i></div></div><div class="sidebar"><div class="side-feature"><h2>About me</h2><p>Some text Some text Some text Some text Some text Some text Some secondary-article-text</p></div><div class="side-feature"><h2>Contacts</h2><p>Some text Some text Some text Some text Some text Some text Some secondary-article-text</p></div><div class="side-feature"><h2>Tools & techologies</h2><p>Some text Some text Some text Some text Some text Some text Some secondary-article-text</p></div><div class="side-feature"><h2>Additionally</h2><p>Some text Some text Some text Some text Some text Some text Some secondary-article-text</p></div><div class="statistics"><div class="active-readers"><p><span></span> <i class="fa fa-user-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i> Active readers</p></div><div class="story-articles"><p><span></span> <i class="fa fa-pencil" aria-hidden="true"></i> Story articles</p></div><div class="comments"><p><span></span> <i class="fa fa-comments" aria-hidden="true"></i> Comments</p></div><div class="Goodinc"><p><span></span> <i class="fa fa-comments" aria-hidden="true"></i> Goodinc</p></div></div></div></div></main><footer><div class="footer-logo-line"><div class="footer-logo-content"><div class="logo"></div><p>Good inc.</p><div class="footer-menu-items"><div class="menu-item"><a href="#">Portfolio</a></div><span>|</span><div class="menu-item"><a href="#">Services</a></div><span>|</span><div class="menu-item"><a href="#">Staff</a></div><span>|</span><div class="menu-item"><a href="#">Articles</a></div><span>|</span><div class="menu-item"><a href="#">Contact</a></div></div></div></div><div class="footer-links"><ul><li><a href="#">About us</a></li><li><a href="#">Footer Links here</a></li><li><a href="#">Privacy</a></li><li><a href="#">Page Links also</a></li></ul><p>Some footer text about this page and something else.
